      <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
      <p>The Lion is a regal and imposing breed. It boasts a sturdy 
        and muscular build, with a thick, luxurious mane around the neck, 
        giving it an aura of majesty. Its coat is a rich, golden color, 
        and it is incredibly soft to the touch. The eyes of the Lion are intense and penetrating, usually a deep amber or golden hue, radiating wisdom and strength. Its tail is long and tufted at the end, adding to its royal appearance.</p>

    <h3>TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    <p> The Lion is surprisingly gentle and affectionate. It is fiercely 
      loyal and protective. This breed is known for its calm and confident 
      demeanor, exuding a quiet strength and grace. While it retains a hint 
      of independence, it enjoys the company of its family and is often found 
      lounging in the sun or sitting by the window, observing its surroundings 
      with a watchful eye. The Lion is intelligent, with a keen sense of curiosity, 
      making it an excellent companion for those who appreciate a thoughtful and

      <h3>CARE + MAINTENANCE</h3>
      <p>The Lion requires a spacious living environment to accommodate its 
        larger size. Regular grooming is necessary to maintain its mane and 
        coat, as well as to minimize shedding. Providing stimulating toys and 
        interactive playtime is essential to keep this intelligent breed mentally 
        and physically engaged. Despite its royal demeanor, the Lion enjoys cuddling 
        and affection from its owners, making it a loving and devoted pet.</p>

      <h3>SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
      <p>Due to its size and natural instincts, the Lion requires responsible ownership. 
        Proper training and socialization from an early age are crucial to ensure it grows 
        into a well-behaved and well-adjusted companion. It's important to provide ample 
        opportunities for exercise and mental stimulation to prevent boredom, as a stimulated 
        lion cat is a happy and content one.</p>
