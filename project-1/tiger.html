            The tiger is an extraordinary and majestic feline companion. The Tiger is a large and muscular breed. 
            Its coat is luxurious, ranging from deep amber to rich golden hues, with black stripes running along 
            its body. The patterns are intricate and unique to each cat, displaying a combination of bold stripes 
            and subtle spots. Their eyes are striking and expressive, usually a mesmerizing shade of amber or emerald 
            green, reflecting their wild ancestry. Despite their large size, they move with incredible grace and agility.
          </p>
          <p class="info-care">
            Tigers require a spacious environment to roam and explore, preferably with access to an enclosed 
            outdoor area where they can satisfy their natural instincts to climb and observe. Grooming their 
            dense fur is essential to maintain its luster, requiring regular brushing to minimize shedding. 
            Despite their wild lineage, they adapt well to indoor living, provided they receive sufficient 
            physical and mental stimulation. A balanced diet, regular vet check-ups, and vaccinations are 
            crucial for their overall health and well-being.
          </p>
          <p class="info-temper">
            Despite their wild appearance, Tigers have a surprisingly gentle and affectionate temperament. 
            They are fiercely loyal to their human companions, forming strong bonds with their families.
             While they retain a hint of independence, they are also known for their playful and curious nature. 
             These cats are highly intelligent, making them quick learners and excellent problem solvers. 
             They enjoy interactive play and mental stimulation, often engaging in activities that challenge 
             their agile minds.

        <p class="due-to">
          Due to their wild ancestry, Tigers require responsible ownership. 
          Proper training and socialization from an early age are essential 
          to ensure they grow into well-behaved pets. It's important to remember 
          that, despite their domestication, they retain some natural instincts, 
          so providing appropriate outlets for their energy and curiosity is vital.
